Job seekers often face challenges in finding suitable job vacancies, especially those in close proximity to their location. This presents significant difficulties, as job applicants generally prefer opportunities that are not far from their place of residence. That's why we introduce you to the LoTer Application or "Lokasi Terdekat", that if you translate it to english, it's mean "Nearest Job Vacancies".

LoTer is an application that uses Maps navigation which aims to display information on nearby job vacancies to users, making it easier for applicants to find nearby jobs. You don't need to worry about time, you can apply for a job in just one tap. And if you are the company that seek for new employee, you can use this app also. Just like scrolling Social Media, you can see the applicant, without open your email, or even open your computer! 

just simply tap, tap, and tap, you can get a new job or even a new employee!
